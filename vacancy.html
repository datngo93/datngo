              Are you interested in building a software tool for social good?
              We are recruiting a student assistant at the University of Amsterdam to help program a software tool for a citizen science project.
              The tool will be used by local communities in the IJmond region in the Netherlands to monitor air pollution from a steel-making factory using camera data.
              More information about the project can be found at <a href="https://ijmondcam.multix.io/">this website</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              Your main tasks include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p class="text">
                  Build a data engineering pipeline to extract video clips from the camera stream for citizens to label whether the clips contain smoke emissions or not, based on available code from the <a href="https://www.fruitpunch.ai/challenges/ai-against-toxic-clouds">AI against Toxic Clouds challenge</a>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p class="text">
                  Adapt an <a href="https://github.com/CMU-CREATE-Lab/deep-smoke-machine">available computer vision pipeline</a> to detect smoke emission in the IJmond camera data, which includes running experiments to evaluate model performance, and also deploying the model to process the live camera stream.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p class="text">
                  Engineer a dashboard for local communities to better understand smoke emissions from the steel factory (e.g., how bad the emission is, how frequent the emissions are, and how likely the emissions will violate air pollution law).
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text">
              Our ideal candidate is a current master's student who can work with Python and JavaScript/HTML/CSS code. You are encouraged to take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/MultiX-Amsterdam/ijmond-camera-monitor">current code infrastructure</a> before applying for this vacancy.

              The preferred starting time of the job is early February 2024. The preferred duration is from February to the end of August, where the student assistant works part-time from February to June, and works full-time in July and August. This means we expect the student assistant to maintain a valid student status at a Dutch university at least until the end of August 2024.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              You will work with Yen-Chia Hsu (assistant professor in the Multimedia Analytics Lab) and Katja Rogers (assistant professor in the Digital Interactions Lab). The project is funded by the <a href="https://www.nwo.nl/en/calls/open-science-fund-2023">NWO Open Science program</a>.
              Your salary will be paid based on the SA pay scale in the <a href="https://www.universiteitenvannederland.nl/cao/financiele-arbeidsvoorwaarden">Dutch Collective Labour Agreement</a>.
